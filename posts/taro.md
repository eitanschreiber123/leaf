**About**
A stuffy, fleshy underground root Taro. It is oval/globular in shape with a hairy coating on its skin and whitish yellow flesh.

**Storage and Uses**
Store it in a cool, dark and well ventilated place. Refrigeration makes it take longer to cook. While consuming, the outer skin is always taken away first. It is never eaten raw. Peeled Taro should be kept in a bowl with water until ready to use. Taro can be roasted, fried, or boiled.

**Benifits**
Taro are rich in carbohydrates and dietary fiber. They contain high levels of vitamin A, C, E, vitamin B6, and folate and regulate blood glucose levels, blood pressure, hypertension, and prevent cell damage. They are especially beneficial in treating cancers of lungs and oral cavity. They also help in protecting from cold and flu and aid in skin rashes and nausea.
