**Benifits**
Yams are a good source of vitamin C. They also provide a good amount of fiber, potassium, manganese, and metabolic B vitamins. The content of vitamin B6 is good for shrinking the effects of homocysteine, which can do real damage to cell walls and ultimately lead to heart attacks and/or stroke.

The crunchy edible root is chiefly composed of complex carbohydrates and soluble dietary fiber.
