Copra is the dried kernel of the coconut used to extract coconut oil. Copra has traditionally been grated and ground then boiled in water to extract coconut oil. It was used by Pacific island cultures and became a valuable commercial product for merchants in the South Seas and South Asia in the 1860s.

Making copra – removing the shell, breaking it up, drying – is usually done where the coconut palms grow. Copra can be made by smoke drying, sun drying, or kiln drying. Copra are naturally dried under the shade for nine to twelve months. Copra meal can also contain 20-22% crude protein. 100 g kernel consists of 354 calories.
